The following table lists the **City tax Parameters** of Swikly's Transaction Link. These parameters can be combined to the **Standard Parameters** in order to request the payment of the city tax by the end-user.

| Parameter | Description |
| ---| --- |
| **[cityTax](#citytax)** | Amount of the city tax in euro cents per adult and per night.|

## cityTax
Amount of the city tax in euro cents per adult and per night. If set, a payment of the city tax of the corresponding amount will be requested alongside any other payment, deposit or reservation request. If not set or set to 0, no city tax payment will be requested.  
The `startDate` and `endDate` parameters are mandatory when a city tax payment is requested.  
If the `adultsNbr` and `childrenNbr` parameters are not set, the `overviewDisplay` parameter has to be set to 1 - default value - and a select box for each option will be presented to the end-user on the **[overview page](/Swikly-Link-Documentation)**.
